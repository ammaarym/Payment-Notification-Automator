# Payment-Notification-Automator

This is a Python script to send a monthly SMS reminder for credit card payments.

Overview
The script uses the Twilio API to send an SMS message to your phone on the 8th of every month, reminding you to pay your credit card bill.

It uses a scheduled Cron job to run the Python code each month. The SMS is sent using your Twilio credentials and phone number.

Usage
To use this script:

Sign up for a Twilio account and get your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number to send messages from.
Fill in your Twilio credentials and phone number in the Python script.
Schedule the Python script to run on the 1st of each month using Cron or a scheduling app like Airflow.
Receive an SMS reminder on the 8th of each month telling you to pay your credit card bill!
Customization
You can easily customize the reminder date, message text, and schedule by modifying the Python script.

Dependencies
Python 3
Twilio SDK for Python
Cron or other scheduler
Let me know if you would like me to modify or add anything to this README! I can also create a requirements.txt file to specify the Twilio dependency.
